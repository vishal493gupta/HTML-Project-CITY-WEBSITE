            <h4><p>Sikandra is a grandiose complex famous for being the home of the tomb of Akbar the Great, the greatest Mughal leader. This glorious monument showcases a harmonious fusion of Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic and Jain art and architecture. Marvel at a collection of lavish red sandstone and marble gateways, chambers and minarets. Enjoy a moment of peace and serenity while wandering along the pathways of a tree-shaded garden.

                Emperor Akbar started work on Sikandra and his own mausoleum in the early 1600s and it was completed by his son, Jehangir. Akbar’s dream was to create a blend of religious themes befitting of his well-known tolerance of spiritual beliefs. The complex takes its name from Sikandra Lodi, the former Sultan of Delhi who established the district in which it stands.The building is a 5-tier structure that resembles the shape of a truncated pyramid. Adorning the exterior walls are huge iwans, which are vaulted halls, beautified by mosaics and semi-precious stones. Look up to see a series of chhatri and minarets. Inside, colorful floral, Arabic and calligraphic patterns festoon the hallway that connects to the Tomb of Akbar the Great. Additional chambers house the graves of Akbar’s daughters and the Mughal princess Zeb-un-Nisa.</p></h4>
